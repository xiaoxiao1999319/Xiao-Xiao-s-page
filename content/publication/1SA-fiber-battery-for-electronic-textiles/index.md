abstract: Electronic textiles (e-textiles), having the capability of interacting with the human body and surroundings, are changing our everyday life in fundamental and meaningful ways. Yet, the expansion of the field of e-textiles is still limited by the lack of stable and biocompatible power sources with aesthetic designs. Here, we report a rechargeable solid-state Zn/MnO2 fiber battery with stable cyclic performance exceeding 500 hours while maintaining 98.0% capacity after more than 1000 charging/recharging cycles. The mechanism of the high electrical and mechanical performance due to the graphene oxideâ€“embedded polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel electrolytes was rationalized by Monte Carlo simulation and finite element analysis. With a collection of key features including thin, light weight, economic, and biocompatible as well as high energy density, the Zn/MnO2 fiber battery could seamlessly be integrated into a multifunctional on-body e-textile, which provides a stable power unit for continuous and simultaneous heart rate, temperature, humidity, and altitude monitoring.
