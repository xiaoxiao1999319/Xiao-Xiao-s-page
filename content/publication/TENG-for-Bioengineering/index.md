abstract: Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are able to convert low-frequency biomechanical motions into characteristically high-voltage and low-current electrical signals via a coupling of contact electrification and electrostatic induction. The generated electrical signals from human body motions could be utilized as sustainable power sources, active biomonitoring, and electrical stimulation therapeutics. Resulting from the unique working principle, the TENGs hold a collection of compelling features for bioengineering, including light-weight, structural simpleness, wide-range of soft materials choice, biocompatibility, and cost-effectiveness. These features endow the feasibility and advantages of using TENGs to build up a body area network for personalized healthcare. The body area network could be autonomous and independent of external power supply. Here we comprehensively reviewed advancements in using TENGs for on-body energy, sensing, and therapy applications. Furthermore, we also proposed and highlighted the guidelines for building an autonomous body area network based on TENGs. We conclude our review with a discussion of the challenges and problems of leveraging triboelectric nanogenerators for bioengineering.
summary: We deliver a review to introduce the wide-range potential of TENGs as an emerging technological platform which will penetrate many medical fields.
